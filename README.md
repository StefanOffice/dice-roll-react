# DiceRoll - a mini react project

This project is an example of using and connecting react components to create an animated dice roll.  There are only 3 components, and for now it shows 2 six-sided dice, but it is built in a way that can be expanded to fit more dice (with minimal modification), as well as different sided dice.
